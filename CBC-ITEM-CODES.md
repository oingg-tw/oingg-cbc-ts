# CBC Statistical Database — Item Code Catalog

Transcribed from the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan)'s official
document *"Introduction to the API of the CBC Statistical Database"*. This is
the source-of-truth for which `ItemCode` to pass to the query endpoint below —
use it instead of guessing codes.

## Query syntax

```
GET https://cpx.cbc.gov.tw/API/DataAPI/Get?FileName={ItemCode}
```

Example: NTD-USD daily exchange rate is `BP01D01en`, so:
`https://cpx.cbc.gov.tw/API/DataAPI/Get?FileName=BP01D01en`

The response is JSON with three parts:

1. **header** — basic info about the item.
2. **dataset** — the actual data series.
3. **structure** — dimensional/column info for the dataset.

The exact shape of each part is not documented and appears to vary by item —
fetch a real item with `src/adapters/cbc/index.ts`'s `fetchCbcItem(itemCode)`
and inspect the real response before writing a parser (paste real JSON →
diff/fix, same workflow as oingg-mops-ts).

Item code suffixes encode the period: `Y` = Year, `Q` = Quarter, `M` = Month,
`D` = Day.

## ⚠️ Known anomalies in the source document

The source PDF lists the same code for two different periods in two places —
this looks like a typo in CBC's document, not a real API behavior:

- **Loans and Discounts at All Banks → By Amount**: both Year and Month rows
  are printed as `EI97Y01en`.
- **Bonds Market → Transactions**: both Year and Month rows are printed as
  `EG23Y01en`.

Verify these against a live request (or the CBC Statistical Database website)
before relying on them for the Month period.
